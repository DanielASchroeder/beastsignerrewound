        <p class="HeadingSpecialA">What is Beast Signer?</p>
        <p class="paragraphtextSpecialA">Beast Signer is an old Flash game from 2008 which only ever had a demo release. It was developed by
            Pseudolonewolf (NOT ME), creator of Mardek and Sindrel Song. In 2013, the game was effectively deemed 'abandoned' in favor of other projects,
            never to be updated again.

        <p class="HeadingSpecialB">The Game's Premise</p>
        <p class="paragraphtextSpecialB">The premise of Beast Signer is fairly simple on the surface. There's a virtual reality called
            "The Machine", where many people are living following a nuclear war that wiped out most of the planet. The problem is, there
            are glitches in The Machine that manifest as monsters, termed 'Beasts'. In order to keep these beasts from terrorizing the people
            living in The Machine, you take on a position as a member of the Signer Elite! The mechanics are similar to Pokemon, with some
            key differences.

        <p class="HeadingSpecialA">This Site's Purpose</p>
        <p class="paragraphtextSpecialA">You might be wondering: If this game was abandoned, why is there a site for it here? That's a great question.
            I've been a fan of the game for many years, despite the complete lack of new content. Eventually, I decided to start putting this
            site together as a sort of tribute to the game. There's also some technical things from the game that I've ripped for use, like...

        <p class="paragraphtextSpecialA">Calculating damage in any game can be a technical mystery. Here, you can find a gauge that gives you minimum
            and maximum damage an attack could do! Made much easier by pasting in a beast from the generator. <br> <br>
